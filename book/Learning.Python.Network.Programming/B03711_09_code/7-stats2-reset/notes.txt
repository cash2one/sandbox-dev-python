Finally we add a reset button for our stats. 

Here we introduce Flask's message flashing system.

We've added a 'reset' button to the stats page. When it's clicked, we POST to
the /stats page and it clears our session stats, then redirects to the stats
page again. We use POST because that is the designated HTTP method to use when
we want our HTTP request to change some state. This is as opposed to GET,
which by convention should never change state. The redirect is used because if
the user uses the browser's back button it won't retrigger the POST operation
which clears the stats. Although that wouldn't be much of a problem here, in
more consequential apps accidentally retriggering a POST could have unwelcome
outcomes ("One is sure one only ordered the one Rolls Royce").

In order to notify the user that the stats have been cleared we use Flask
message flashing. The flash() function we use in search() adds a flash message
to the session. These messages are retrievable by the app when it recieves the
next request from the client, but are then discarded. They are great for
showing one-time messages such as 'incorrect password'. Here we flash the
'Stats cleared!' message, and then render it in the stats.html template using
the get_flashed_messages() function.
