Here we move the home button up to a nav bar in the top right. 

We do this using the {% include %} Jinja2 statement, which lets us insert
a block of code delared in another template. Unlike inheritance, this
just takes the included file wholesale and inserts it, there is no reverse
matching of blocks or anything.

See base.html and nav.html for the example of this.
