Can you give examples of what he can do with magic?\nThe main point here is looking for information.  Wizards don't have computers (at least at the time of the events in the books), but they may have some magical help I haven't noticed.  Magic used for other things in a library, such as books that scream when stolen, or magically reinforced buildings, aren't on topic for this question.\nI can only think of one example from the books, and even that is doubtful: Hermione has somehow summoned the books about Horcruxes from Professor Dumbledore's room in Deathly Hallows. \nWe don't see much of Madam Pince's work.  I don't recall any time the students ask for her services.  I don't know if that's because they don't trust her, or because we only see them look for information about topics they would rather keep secret (eg. the Philosopher's Stone, Slytherin's monster, or Horcruxes).  There would certainly be a good use for her help, given the amount of essays and other coursework the students do, and the lots of research Hermione does. \nHermione certainly seems to do a lot of searching in books all by hand, and I don't recall her using any magic for this.  But it is possible that it happens off screen, or that this just isn't a strong suit of Hermione, and other wizards are more competent.  It is also possible that Arithmancy is relevant, we know very little about that subject.\nRemark about why I'm asking.  Given that I work with computers, I always sort of wanted to know how wizards in Harry Potter can replace them (at least partly).  Magical fantasy fiction never seems to spend much time about information processing, possibly because it's so new and the books I'm reading are old.

        "body": "\nWhat is Divination really like when it is not just a school subject, but is practically applied by a competent Wizard?  Is there a definition of what counts as Divination in the Harry Potter universe?\nMost of what we know about Divination in the Harry Potter universe is through the school courses of Professor Trelawney and Firenze, plus a few remarks by Professor Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall.  I don't believe these give a fair representation of Divination in the real world, just like how the school curriculum of the first three years of Harry's Defense Against the Dark Arts class wouldn't tell much about how Defense Against the Dark Arts is used by adults.\nTo give some specifics, which of the following (if any) are Divination?\n\nProfessor Snape's task of finding out about the Dark Lord's plan.\nProfessor Dumbledore finding out lots of details about the past of the Dark Lord.\nProfessor Dumbledore coercing Kreacher to tell him what's happened to Sirius.  \nProfessor Dumbledore detecting magic in the cave.\nThe visions Harry had, showing what the Dark Lord or his Snake were doing.\nThe spell used to reveal the last spell cast by a wand, as seen in Goblet of Fire.\nThe Specialis Revelio spell cast by Hermione on the Riddle diary.\nThe examination the Ministry of Magic has done on the objects Professor Dumbledore has left in his will to the trio.\nThe tests done on the Firebolt that Harry got as a gift, ensuring that it is not jinxed.\nThe Homenium Revelio spell cast by Hermione to find humans in the Black manor.\nWhat the Marauder's Map does.\nThe two real prophecies of Professor Trelawney.\n\nI have guesses about how some of the above are Divination and some aren't, but they are all based on what I've heared of divination outside the Harry Potter universe.  There is, however, probably some material in the books, interviews, Pottermore, or other resources that I don't know about.\nTo address a particular argument you might give about the prophecies of Professor Trelawney, recall that Professor Dumbledore wanted to keep Trelawney in Hogwarts to protect her, after the first prophecy and the immediately following events.  The way he insisted that she stay after she was sacked from her teaching position (in the Order of the Phoenix) clearly shows this, together with what he says about the matter in Half-Blood Prince chapter 20:\n\nI cannot ask Firenze to return to the forest, where he is now an outcast, nor can I ask Sybill Trelawney to leave. Between ourselves, she has no idea of the danger she would be in outside the castle. She does not know \u2013 and I think it would be unwise to enlighten her \u2014 that she made the prophecy about you and Voldemort, you see.\n\nThis means that Professor Dumbledore may have applied Trelawney regardless of how good Divination teacher he thought she was, and regardless of whether the prophecy is Divination or not.\nCan you give other examples of Divination used by Wizards, other than the ones related to school courses?  This is a speciesist question, I'm specifically asking only about human Wizards, not about divination practiced by Centaurs or House Elves or Goblins or other creatures.\nRemark.  The original reason why this question came up is a disagreement in the thread Why didn't Dumbledore use magic to figure out what Bertie Bott\u2019s Every Flavor Beans taste like?\n",

Not the present. Not the past. See the sources below for details.\nReveal indirect information, via magical means.\n\nNot finding out direct information, such as reading someone's plan via Legilemency\nNot to construct a logical model to predict the future the way a muggle would. \n\n\nAs such, every one of the examples given by you except the last one aren't divination, as none of them show revealing information about the future via indirect magical means. Only the first one is about the future in the first place, and Snape's work isn't done via indirect magical means, but by old fashioned James Bond ways.\n\n\nWhether the Prophecies are \"divination\" or not is simply a matter of definition.\n\nIf we include only conscious, on-purpose attempts to divine the future, then Trelawney's prophecies aren't \"Divinaton\" in a strict sense of the word. This interpretation is favoured by a train of thought that if something is \"Divination\", it should be teachable in Divination class (either Hogwarts, or maybe something more advanced). Whereas, Prophecy isn't teachable... it just happens.\nOn the other hand, it's a magical way of revealing the future, so according to the definition we started out with, it IS Divination. This interpretation is in line with thinking that spontaneous magic is still magic - if Harry re-grows his hair, it's still Transfiguration.\n\n\n\nSOURCES\nWhat do we know about Divination aside from what the books say relative to Trelawney's class and some remarks by Professores AD and MM?\n\nDivination details aren't really mentioned in JKR interviews. There's one direct mention (proving it's about the future only) and one tangential mention:\n\nJKR: Yeah, he starts learning Divination, and so...\nLS: Telling about the future...\nJKR: Uh-huh, foretelling the future. I know a lot about foretelling the future, without, I have to say, believing in it... (src)\nJK Rowling: ... at one point there was a blind character who went by the name of Mopsus, ... he sort of \u00ad\u00ad that was a very early character and he had the power of second sight, in other words he was a bit like Professor Trelawney, he was a very, very early character, this was when I was drafting Philosopher's Stone, the reason I cut him was he was too good. As the story evolved, if there was somebody who really could do divination at the time that Harry was alive, it greatly diminished the drama of the story because someone out there knew what was going to happen. (src)\n\nPottermore offers very little detail, but also confirms it's about the future.\nThe textbook for the class used on Pottermore is \"Unfogging the Future\" by Cassandra Vablatsky.\n\n",

It is said that dragons devoured some of the Seven, but apparently that destroyed those rings. So much for Precious.\nPerhaps most relevant: Shelob. Paralyses Frodo, but does she in any way go for the ring? No. Sure, Sam attacks before she has much time.

Because:\n\nIt was not the Middle Ages. In the XXth century, it was already well stablished that \"explosive\" == \"relases a lot of energy quickly\". Once a way was discovered to release such energy was found, you automatically got the atomic bomb scientific base and only that was left was an engineering task.\nH. G. Wells does not provide any insight that would have inspired the discovery such as a method to increase the energy release. He just mixes some \"hot\" (for the time) scientific terms and \"technomagically\" invents \"Carolinum\"1.\nSzilard was not the only one researching atomic energy, and not the only one to see its potential if a method for controlling the reaction speed could be controlled. Note the big \"if\", which is what really matters for the scientific progress, and which is absent of H. G. Wells novel2.\n\nTo put an example, as soon as antimatter (and its violent relation to normal matter) was discovered/made public, lots of SF books were about antimatter guns/bomb/cannons/whatever being \"invented\".\nCould you say that, in case that an antimatter weapon was developed, that any of those works \"inspired\" the development of the actual weapon? Hardly, because it was an idea so evident that it did not need inspiration.\nThe actual inspiration could come by an author explaining how to produce / manage antimatter in an effective way that happens to be actually effective.\nAnd for other meanings of \"inspiration\" (more to come as comments appear, I think):\n\nSzilard was not a salesman that read H. G. Wells book, thought \"hey, it is cool\", set up his own laboratory and found the idea of chain reaction. He was already an scientist studying the atomic structure.

                "body": "\nThe short answer is \"no\".  \nHow a Theory is Born\nA good analogy to the relationship you speculate on between Wells and the atom bomb is the influences on Charles Darwin.  Before Darwin ever dreamed of the theory that would later make him famous, and even before he was born, works on evolution had already appeared in print, most famously the works of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck.  But there was actually an evolutionist in Darwin's own family tree.  His grandfather, the British polymath Erasmus Darwin, had published a book of science-based poetry called Zo\u00f6nomia, or the Laws of Organic Life, in 1794.  Zo\u00f6nomia contained speculation about how animal and plant life changes over time, and in retrospect, it bears some minor similarities to the modern theory of evolution.  Charles Darwin was familiar with both of these works, but he seems to have rejected them from as early as he began to study science.\nHe came to see that a form of evolutionary theory was indeed correct, of course,  but he did so on the basis of an extraordinary amount of evidence, some of which he had discovered himself on his famous voyage aboard the HMS Beagle.  When he published his iconic work, On the Origin of Species, it was not a result of his familiarity with previous variations on the theme of evolution;  it was based on  a tremendous amount of research, including his own original findings, and was distinct from earlier forms of vaguely similar ideas in the sense that he followed the scientific method very scrupulously.  For the first time, evolution was described in a rigidly scientific manner, relying almost exclusively on actual evidence rather than wild speculation.  \nHe wasn't the first person to theorize that species changed over time;  he was the first to attribute this phenomenon to natural selection.  He remained highly critical (even contemptuous) of Lamarck, and while he presumably felt some degree of affection for Erasmus Darwin, who was, after all, his grandfather, he didn't owe anything to Erasmus' work (which was more artistic than scientific in tone and origin).  Neither Lamarck nor Erasmus were the inspiration for Darwin's discovery - Darwin himself was the man responsible for the breakthrough.  \nThis is the way science works.  A person might have a sort of epiphany after reading a fictional story, but it would be meaningless if the person in question didn't have some prior experience in the relevant field of study.  If the field of study already exists, it is because we already know it is a feasible source of new information.  You can't attribute discoveries within that field to the fact that someone working in the field read a work of fiction, no matter how interesting or appealing the idea that the fictional story led to the discovery may be.  \nThe Advent of the Atomic Age\nWe generally associate the development of nuclear energy and weapons to the theory of general relativity, which Einstein put forth in the first decade of the twentieth century, more than a decade before the publication of Wells' book.  Many other people were involved in the process, of course, including Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd.  Yes, Szil\u00e1rd had read The World Set Free a year or two  before he conceived of the idea of neutron chain reactions, but this isn't as important a connection as it may first appear.  He had already been a physicist for over 13 years by the time he patented the concept of chain reactions, and 11 years before he read The World Set Free.  Clearly, his lengthy experience in the field was of more import than what he did in his spare time, including reading the book.\nIn fact, Szil\u00e1rd himself attributed his idea to the outrage he felt at hearing a speech by Ernest Rutherford.  In the speech, Rutherford said:\n\n\"We might in these processes obtain very much more energy than the proton supplied, but on the average we could not expect to obtain energy in this way. It was a very poor and inefficient way of producing energy, and anyone who looked for a source of power in the transformation of the atoms was talking moonshine. But the subject was scientifically interesting because it gave insight into the atoms.\"\n\nThe Wikipedia page (already linked and) for Szil\u00e1rd explains: \n\nSzilard was so annoyed at Rutherford's dismissal that he conceived of the idea of nuclear chain reaction (analogous to a chemical chain reaction), using recently discovered neutrons. The idea did not use the mechanism of nuclear fission, which was not yet discovered, but Szilard realized that if neutrons could initiate any sort of energy-producing nuclear reaction, such as the one that had occurred in lithium, and could be produced themselves by the same reaction, energy might be obtained with little input, since the reaction would be self-sustaining. The following year he filed for a patent on the concept of the neutron-induced nuclear chain reaction.  Richard Rhodes described Szilard's moment of inspiration:\n\"In London, where Southampton Row passes Russell Square, across from the British Museum in Bloomsbury, Leo Szilard waited irritably one gray Depression morning for the stoplight to change. A trace of rain had fallen during the night; Tuesday, September 12, 1933, dawned cool, humid and dull. Drizzling rain would begin again in early afternoon. When Szilard told the story later he never mentioned his destination that morning. He may have had none; he often walked to think. In any case another destination intervened. The stoplight changed to green. Szilard stepped off the curb. As he crossed the street time cracked open before him and he saw a way to the future, death into the world and all our woes, the shape of things to come.\"\n\nAn article from Scientific American continues:\n\nWhat Szilard realised as he stepped off that curb was that if we found an element that when bombarded by one neutron would release two neutrons, it could lead to a chain reaction that could possibly release vast amounts of energy. Leo Szil\u00e1rd had discovered the nuclear chain reaction long before anyone else, six years before the discovery of nuclear fission and any inkling that anyone could have had about the release of atomic energy, let alone the woeful apocalyptic future that would await the world because of its release.\n\nFurthermore, the idea of the atom had been around for millennia prior to Wells' story.  While the relationship between Wells' book and the atomic bomb is merely coincidental, the fact that Wells' book was published just before a series of fast paced developments in virtually every field of scientific research, including nuclear science, is not coincidental.  We were working on the idea because we were finally able to do so, and Wells wrote about it because we were starting to work on it.  He says so himself in the first chapter of the book: \n\nThe problem which was already being mooted by such scientific men as [William] Ramsay, [Ernest] Rutherford, and [Frederick] Soddy, in the very beginning of the twentieth century, the problem of inducing radio-activity in the heavier elements and so tapping the internal energy of atoms, was solved by a wonderful combination of induction, intuition, and luck by Holsten so soon as the year 1933.\n\nThe \"Holsten\" he mentions is one of the characters in the story.  Ramsay, Rutherford (for whom Rutherfordium is named), and Soddy were some of the physicists who pioneered early research into the atom in real life.  Ernest Rutherford coined the phrase \"atomic energy\" in 1903.  Wells' knowledge of the atom came from these men - quite the opposite of the relationship you have suggested.  Wells only thought of the idea because people like these were already hard at work on the problem of how to harness the power of the atom, not the other way around.\nWe were starting to work on understanding and harnessing the atom because, although the first mention of the atom occurred thousands of years ago, the atom as we know it was discovered in 1895.  Basically, Wells was one of the first authors to mention atomic weapons in a fictional story because the existence of the atom was only confirmed 18 years earlier.  \nWells' Atomic Bomb:\nIf Wells' story was influential enough to make Szil\u00e1rd think up neutron chain reactions, we might be forgiven for wondering why he bothered to do it at all.  Wells' bombs are pretty unimpressive.\n\nWells's \"atomic bombs\" have no more force than ordinary high explosive and are rather primitive devices detonated by a \"bomb-thrower\" biting off \"a little celluloid stud.\"\n\nIn case you weren't wondering, the \"bomb-thrower\" isn't a machine, it's a guy who literally throws atomic bombs like oversized hand grenades:\n\nThe gaunt face hardened to grimness, and with both hands the bomb-thrower lifted the big atomic bomb from the box and steadied it against the side. It was a black sphere two feet in diameter. Between its handles was a little celluloid stud, and to this he bent his head until his lips touched it. Then he had to bite in order to let the air in upon the inducive. \n\nThis is a tactical weapon, not a strategic weapon.  Our own brief experimentation with tactical nuclear weapons for use by frontline soldiers, such as the atomic artillery guns, didn't last very long.  It also sounds more like a dirty bomb than a true atomic bomb.\nRenowned physicist Lawrence Krauss recently commented on the question of Wells' depiction of the bomb:\n\n\"The novel was published in 1914 and anticipated the development of atomic weapons that would be used in war. Decades before they became a harsh reality in the modern world \u2014 and perhaps influencing some of the scientists who created the real weapons \u2014 the novel coined the term \"atomic bombs.\".\n\"Nevertheless not only did Wells' continually burning atomic weapons bear no resemblance to the engines of destruction in the real world,\" Krauss emphasized, \"he thought it would unite the world into one society whereas we are painfully aware that it hasn't changed human thinking, except to divide the world into nuclear haves and have-nots.\"\n\nWhy Build an Atom Bomb?\nOnce we knew that atoms existed, it was pretty much inevitable that we would try to find a way to use them to kill people.  This is, tragically, par for the course.  Many of our most important advances in technology are made because we love killing each other so much.  We have metals like steel and iron in large part because we wanted to stab everyone with them.  We have explosives because Chinese people liked fireworks, but as soon as gunpowder came to the Western world, we used it to lob big balls at each other from cannons. Long before the germ theory of disease was proposed, Mongols were lobbing the corpses of people killed by the plague over city walls in order to spread the disease and wipe out everyone inside, and centuries later, Europeans were deliberately spreading smallpox among the native inhabitants of the Americas.  \nAnd more to the point, we have atomic weapons because they are REALLY good at killing a horrendous number of people at once, not because H.G. Wells wrote a book.  The World Set Free was published more than a decade after the atom was discovered, and research was already well under way by then.  If Wells' book had never been written, we would have built atomic weapons for use in WWII anyway.  Once mankind finds a new toy, it is only a matter of time before we figure out how to murder each other with it.  Wells was probably the first author to mention atomic weapons, but only because we were rapidly approaching the realization of the hideous potential of such weapons.  And if you read the story yourself, you will see that he had no idea how a real atomic bomb might work, or how atomic energy might be harnessed.\nIn short, no, we didn't invent atomic weapons because of Wells' story.  We invented them because we are monsters.\n\nFurther reading:\nThe Birth of Modern Physics\nChronology of the Atomic Age\nHistory of Nuclear Power \nHistory of Nuclear Energy \nHistory of Nuclear Weapons \n",

We don't seem to witness anything like this happening on screen, in my opinion, although there are some fans who say otherwise. \nIt is impossible to talk about this fan theory without making reference to the extremely contentious issue of when Blair was infected/assimilated.  Both John Carpenter and producer Stuart Cohen insist that neither they, nor anyone else, know when any of the off-screen assimilations took place, but Cohen has suggested that, in his own opinion as a fan (but not as the producer), he thinks Blair was assimilated sometime between the autopsy on the two headed (popularly known as \"split face\") Thing and his freak out in the radio room.  This fan theory conforms to this general time frame.  \nAccording to this particular fan theory, which is just one of many such theories regarding the question of when Blair was infected, Blair inadvertently infected himself during the autopsy.  From the fan site Outpost 31's discussion thread on the issue of Blair's infection:\n\n\nIf this theory is correct, and if split face was really dead, then it appears that a dead Thing can infect a person.  \nAs I was writing this, it occurred to me that the Blair pencil theory isn't necessary to prove that a dead Thing can infect a person.  All we need to know is whether the split face Thing was actually dead, because Bennings was unquestionably infected by split face - or at least by the slimy tentacle dripping off of split face.  \nWhen split face, covered in a sheet after the autopsy, is moved into the storage room, Bennings and Windows go into the room to collect their gear and move it.  Windows leaves to get the Garry's keys, and we see a slimy tentacle emerging from under the sheet.  \n\nWhen Windows returns, he sees this:\n\nBennings is in the process of being assimilated.  Windows is naturally terrified, and runs out of the room.  He alerts the others, but by the time they reach the storage room, the window is broken and Bennings-Thing is gone.  They run outside and spot the Thing, surround it, and it produces what might be the most incredible sound ever heard in a movie:  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, if split face was truly dead when MacReady and Copper found it, then it is almost certain that a dead Thing is still infectious.  The problem with this idea is that, after the team discovers that Bennings has been infected, they seem to assume that split face wasn't as dead as they had previously believed, so they drag it outside and burn it.  \nIn the absence of definitive information about the status of split face at the time of Bennings' assimilation, this argument is completely conjectural in nature, and the most we can infer from Bennings' fate is that a Thing which appears to be dead can still be infectious.\nIf we rely on the Blair theory, the problem is compounded:  we still don't know whether split face was really dead, and on top of that, we don't know if this was really the moment when Blair was infected.  \nHowever, I don't see how anyone could argue that split face was truly dead, in light of the fact that it extended a tentacle and grabbed Bennings.  This leaves us right where we started - we just don't have enough information to answer the question either way. \nIn short, we simply don't know.\n",

He doesn't with Brienne, but he may well feel that he should, because that's what he thinks he is supposed to do with women he cares about and respects. I think that even Jamie isn't sure about his own feelings; he has some kind of emotions and he isn't entirely sure how to deal with them.\n",

        "body": "\nDoes magic make it easier for a competent Wizard librarian to search for information, compared to what a competent Muggle librarian can do?  Can you give examples of what he can do with magic?\nThe main point here is looking for information.  Wizards don't have computers (at least at the time of the events in the books), but they may have some magical help I haven't noticed.  Magic used for other things in a library, such as books that scream when stolen, or magically reinforced buildings, aren't on topic for this question.\nI can only think of one example from the books, and even that is doubtful: Hermione has somehow summoned the books about Horcruxes from Professor Dumbledore's room in Deathly Hallows. \nWe don't see much of Madam Pince's work.  I don't recall any time the students ask for her services.  I don't know if that's because they don't trust her, or because we only see them look for information about topics they would rather keep secret (eg. the Philosopher's Stone, Slytherin's monster, or Horcruxes).  There would certainly be a good use for her help, given the amount of essays and other coursework the students do, and the lots of research Hermione does. \nHermione certainly seems to do a lot of searching in books all by hand, and I don't recall her using any magic for this.  But it is possible that it happens off screen, or that this just isn't a strong suit of Hermione, and other wizards are more competent.  It is also possible that Arithmancy is relevant, we know very little about that subject.\nRemark about why I'm asking.  Given that I work with computers, I always sort of wanted to know how wizards in Harry Potter can replace them (at least partly).  Magical fantasy fiction never seems to spend much time about information processing, possibly because it's so new and the books I'm reading are old.  This question asks only about a specifc area of this.  Part of what made me ask right now is my previous question What is Divination, as practiced by Wizards, really like? \n",

        "body": "\nWhat is Divination really like when it is not just a school subject, but is practically applied by a competent Wizard?  Is there a definition of what counts as Divination in the Harry Potter universe?\nMost of what we know about Divination in the Harry Potter universe is through the school courses of Professor Trelawney and Firenze, plus a few remarks by Professor Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall.  I don't believe these give a fair representation of Divination in the real world, just like how the school curriculum of the first three years of Harry's Defense Against the Dark Arts class wouldn't tell much about how Defense Against the Dark Arts is used by adults.\nTo give some specifics, which of the following (if any) are Divination?\n\nProfessor Snape's task of finding out about the Dark Lord's plan.\nProfessor Dumbledore finding out lots of details about the past of the Dark Lord.\nProfessor Dumbledore coercing Kreacher to tell him what's happened to Sirius.  \nProfessor Dumbledore detecting magic in the cave.\nThe visions Harry had, showing what the Dark Lord or his Snake were doing.\nThe spell used to reveal the last spell cast by a wand, as seen in Goblet of Fire.\nThe Specialis Revelio spell cast by Hermione on the Riddle diary.\nThe examination the Ministry of Magic has done on the objects Professor Dumbledore has left in his will to the trio.\nThe tests done on the Firebolt that Harry got as a gift, ensuring that it is not jinxed.\nThe Homenium Revelio spell cast by Hermione to find humans in the Black manor.\nWhat the Marauder's Map does.\nThe two real prophecies of Professor Trelawney.\n\nI have guesses about how some of the above are Divination and some aren't, but they are all based on what I've heared of divination outside the Harry Potter universe.  There is, however, probably some material in the books, interviews, Pottermore, or other resources that I don't know about.\nTo address a particular argument you might give about the prophecies of Professor Trelawney, recall that Professor Dumbledore wanted to keep Trelawney in Hogwarts to protect her, after the first prophecy and the immediately following events.  The way he insisted that she stay after she was sacked from her teaching position (in the Order of the Phoenix) clearly shows this, together with what he says about the matter in Half-Blood Prince chapter 20:\n\nI cannot ask Firenze to return to the forest, where he is now an outcast, nor can I ask Sybill Trelawney to leave. Between ourselves, she has no idea of the danger she would be in outside the castle. She does not know \u2013 and I think it would be unwise to enlighten her \u2014 that she made the prophecy about you and Voldemort, you see.\n\nThis means that Professor Dumbledore may have applied Trelawney regardless of how good Divination teacher he thought she was, and regardless of whether the prophecy is Divination or not.\nCan you give other examples of Divination used by Wizards, other than the ones related to school courses?  This is a speciesist question, I'm specifically asking only about human Wizards, not about divination practiced by Centaurs or House Elves or Goblins or other creatures.\nRemark.  The original reason why this question came up is a disagreement in the thread Why didn't Dumbledore use magic to figure out what Bertie Bott\u2019s Every Flavor Beans taste like?\n",

Not the present. Not the past. See the sources below for details.\nReveal indirect information, via magical means.\n\nNot finding out direct information, such as reading someone's plan via Legilemency\nNot to construct a logical model to predict the future the way a muggle would. \n\n\nAs such, every one of the examples given by you except the last one aren't divination, as none of them show revealing information about the future via indirect magical means. Only the first one is about the future in the first place, and Snape's work isn't done via indirect magical means, but by old fashioned James Bond ways.\n\n\nWhether the Prophecies are \"divination\" or not is simply a matter of definition.\n\nIf we include only conscious, on-purpose attempts to divine the future, then Trelawney's prophecies aren't \"Divinaton\" in a strict sense of the word. This interpretation is favoured by a train of thought that if something is \"Divination\", it should be teachable in Divination class (either Hogwarts, or maybe something more advanced). Whereas, Prophecy isn't teachable... it just happens.\nOn the other hand, it's a magical way of revealing the future, so according to the definition we started out with, it IS Divination. This interpretation is in line with thinking that spontaneous magic is still magic - if Harry re-grows his hair, it's still Transfiguration.\n\n\n\nSOURCES\nWhat do we know about Divination aside from what the books say relative to Trelawney's class and some remarks by Professores AD and MM?\n\nDivination details aren't really mentioned in JKR interviews. There's one direct mention (proving it's about the future only) and one tangential mention:\n\nJKR: Yeah, he starts learning Divination, and so...\nLS: Telling about the future...\nJKR: Uh-huh, foretelling the future. I know a lot about foretelling the future, without, I have to say, believing in it... (src)\nJK Rowling: ... at one point there was a blind character who went by the name of Mopsus, ... he sort of \u00ad\u00ad that was a very early character and he had the power of second sight, in other words he was a bit like Professor Trelawney, he was a very, very early character, this was when I was drafting Philosopher's Stone, the reason I cut him was he was too good. As the story evolved, if there was somebody who really could do divination at the time that Harry was alive, it greatly diminished the drama of the story because someone out there knew what was going to happen. (src)\n\nPottermore offers very little detail, but also confirms it's about the future.\nThe textbook for the class used on Pottermore is \"Unfogging the Future\" by Cassandra Vablatsky.\n\n",

The rest are various combinations of non-Divination magical spells, espionage, research, Occlumency (again, not Divination), logic and guesswork.\nUltimately there's no reason to believe that Divination, as practiced by qualified human Wizards, is any different to what Harry learnt in his lessons; except perhaps they'd have more luck at actually predicting the future. I don't believe Professor Trelawney wrote any of the books used by Divination students, and she wasn't the first Divination teacher at the school, so there'd be older generations (and students from other schools?) who have all learnt the same Divination techniques.\n",

Once a way was discovered to release such energy was found, you automatically got the atomic bomb scientific base and only that was left was an engineering task.\nH. G. Wells does not provide any insight that would have inspired the discovery such as a method to increase the energy release.

Before Darwin ever dreamed of the theory that would later make him famous, and even before he was born, works on evolution had already appeared in print, most famously the works of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck.  But there was actually an evolutionist in Darwin's own family tree.  His grandfather, the British polymath Erasmus Darwin, had published a book of science-based poetry called Zo\u00f6nomia, or the Laws of Organic Life, in 1794.  Zo\u00f6nomia contained speculation about how animal and plant life changes over time, and in retrospect, it bears some minor similarities to the modern theory of evolution.  Charles Darwin was familiar with both of these works, but he seems to have rejected them from as early as he began to study science.\nHe came to see that a form of evolutionary theory was indeed correct, of course,  but he did so on the basis of an extraordinary amount of evidence, some of which he had discovered himself on his famous voyage aboard the HMS Beagle.  When he published his iconic work, On the Origin of Species, it was not a result of his familiarity with previous variations on the theme of evolution;  it was based on  a tremendous amount of research, including his own original findings, and was distinct from earlier forms of vaguely similar ideas in the sense that he followed the scientific method very scrupulously.  For the first time, evolution was described in a rigidly scientific manner, relying almost exclusively on actual evidence rather than wild speculation.  \nHe wasn't the first person to theorize that species changed over time;  he was the first to attribute this phenomenon to natural selection.  He remained highly critical (even contemptuous) of Lamarck, and while he presumably felt some degree of affection for Erasmus Darwin, who was, after all, his grandfather, he didn't owe anything to Erasmus' work (which was more artistic than scientific in tone and origin).  Neither Lamarck nor Erasmus were the inspiration for Darwin's discovery - Darwin himself was the man responsible for the breakthrough.  \nThis is the way science works.  A person might have a sort of epiphany after reading a fictional story, but it would be meaningless if the person in question didn't have some prior experience in the relevant field of study.  If the field of study already exists, it is because we already know it is a feasible source of new information.  You can't attribute discoveries within that field to the fact that someone working in the field read a work of fiction, no matter how interesting or appealing the idea that the fictional story led to the discovery may be.  \nThe Advent of the Atomic Age\nWe generally associate the development of nuclear energy and weapons to the theory of general relativity, which Einstein put forth in the first decade of the twentieth century, more than a decade before the publication of Wells' book.  Many other people were involved in the process, of course, including Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd.  Yes, Szil\u00e1rd had read The World Set Free a year or two  before he conceived of the idea of neutron chain reactions, but this isn't as important a connection as it may first appear.  He had already been a physicist for over 13 years by the time he patented the concept of chain reactions, and 11 years before he read The World Set Free.  Clearly, his lengthy experience in the field was of more import than what he did in his spare time, including reading the book.\nIn fact, Szil\u00e1rd himself attributed his idea to the outrage he felt at hearing a speech by Ernest Rutherford.  In the speech, Rutherford said:\n\n\"We might in these processes obtain very much more energy than the proton supplied, but on the average we could not expect to obtain energy in this way. It was a very poor and inefficient way of producing energy, and anyone who looked for a source of power in the transformation of the atoms was talking moonshine. But the subject was scientifically interesting because it gave insight into the atoms.\"\n\nThe Wikipedia page (already linked and) for Szil\u00e1rd explains: \n\nSzilard was so annoyed at Rutherford's dismissal that he conceived of the idea of nuclear chain reaction (analogous to a chemical chain reaction), using recently discovered neutrons. The idea did not use the mechanism of nuclear fission, which was not yet discovered, but Szilard realized that if neutrons could initiate any sort of energy-producing nuclear reaction, such as the one that had occurred in lithium, and could be produced themselves by the same reaction, energy might be obtained with little input, since the reaction would be self-sustaining. The following year he filed for a patent on the concept of the neutron-induced nuclear chain reaction.  Richard Rhodes described Szilard's moment of inspiration:\n\"In London, where Southampton Row passes Russell Square, across from the British Museum in Bloomsbury, Leo Szilard waited irritably one gray Depression morning for the stoplight to change. A trace of rain had fallen during the night; Tuesday, September 12, 1933, dawned cool, humid and dull. Drizzling rain would begin again in early afternoon. When Szilard told the story later he never mentioned his destination that morning. He may have had none; he often walked to think. In any case another destination intervened. The stoplight changed to green. Szilard stepped off the curb. As he crossed the street time cracked open before him and he saw a way to the future, death into the world and all our woes, the shape of things to come.\"\n\nAn article from Scientific American continues:\n\nWhat Szilard realised as he stepped off that curb was that if we found an element that when bombarded by one neutron would release two neutrons, it could lead to a chain reaction that could possibly release vast amounts of energy. Leo Szil\u00e1rd had discovered the nuclear chain reaction long before anyone else, six years before the discovery of nuclear fission and any inkling that anyone could have had about the release of atomic energy, let alone the woeful apocalyptic future that would await the world because of its release.\n\nFurthermore, the idea of the atom had been around for millennia prior to Wells' story.  While the relationship between Wells' book and the atomic bomb is merely coincidental, the fact that Wells' book was published just before a series of fast paced developments in virtually every field of scientific research, including nuclear science, is not coincidental.  We were working on the idea because we were finally able to do so, and Wells wrote about it because we were starting to work on it.  He says so himself in the first chapter of the book: \n\nThe problem which was already being mooted by such scientific men as [William] Ramsay, [Ernest] Rutherford, and [Frederick] Soddy, in the very beginning of the twentieth century, the problem of inducing radio-activity in the heavier elements and so tapping the internal energy of atoms, was solved by a wonderful combination of induction, intuition, and luck by Holsten so soon as the year 1933.\n\nThe \"Holsten\" he mentions is one of the characters in the story.  Ramsay, Rutherford (for whom Rutherfordium is named), and Soddy were some of the physicists who pioneered early research into the atom in real life.  Ernest Rutherford coined the phrase \"atomic energy\" in 1903.  Wells' knowledge of the atom came from these men - quite the opposite of the relationship you have suggested.  Wells only thought of the idea because people like these were already hard at work on the problem of how to harness the power of the atom, not the other way around.\nWe were starting to work on understanding and harnessing the atom because, although the first mention of the atom occurred thousands of years ago, the atom as we know it was discovered in 1895.  Basically, Wells was one of the first authors to mention atomic weapons in a fictional story because the existence of the atom was only confirmed 18 years earlier.  \nWells' Atomic Bomb:\nIf Wells' story was influential enough to make Szil\u00e1rd think up neutron chain reactions, we might be forgiven for wondering why he bothered to do it at all.  Wells' bombs are pretty unimpressive.\n\nWells's \"atomic bombs\" have no more force than ordinary high explosive and are rather primitive devices detonated by a \"bomb-thrower\" biting off \"a little celluloid stud.\"\n\nIn case you weren't wondering, the \"bomb-thrower\" isn't a machine, it's a guy who literally throws atomic bombs like oversized hand grenades:\n\nThe gaunt face hardened to grimness, and with both hands the bomb-thrower lifted the big atomic bomb from the box and steadied it against the side. It was a black sphere two feet in diameter. Between its handles was a little celluloid stud, and to this he bent his head until his lips touched it. Then he had to bite in order to let the air in upon the inducive. \n\nThis is a tactical weapon, not a strategic weapon.  Our own brief experimentation with tactical nuclear weapons for use by frontline soldiers, such as the atomic artillery guns, didn't last very long.  It also sounds more like a dirty bomb than a true atomic bomb.\nRenowned physicist Lawrence Krauss recently commented on the question of Wells' depiction of the bomb:\n\n\"The novel was published in 1914 and anticipated the development of atomic weapons that would be used in war. Decades before they became a harsh reality in the modern world \u2014 and perhaps influencing some of the scientists who created the real weapons \u2014 the novel coined the term \"atomic bombs.\".\n\"Nevertheless not only did Wells' continually burning atomic weapons bear no resemblance to the engines of destruction in the real world,\" Krauss emphasized, \"he thought it would unite the world into one society whereas we are painfully aware that it hasn't changed human thinking, except to divide the world into nuclear haves and have-nots.\"\n\nWhy Build an Atom Bomb?\nOnce we knew that atoms existed, it was pretty much inevitable that we would try to find a way to use them to kill people.  This is, tragically, par for the course.  Many of our most important advances in technology are made because we love killing each other so much.  We have metals like steel and iron in large part because we wanted to stab everyone with them.  We have explosives because Chinese people liked fireworks, but as soon as gunpowder came to the Western world, we used it to lob big balls at each other from cannons. Long before the germ theory of disease was proposed, Mongols were lobbing the corpses of people killed by the plague over city walls in order to spread the disease and wipe out everyone inside, and centuries later, Europeans were deliberately spreading smallpox among the native inhabitants of the Americas.  \nAnd more to the point, we have atomic weapons because they are REALLY good at killing a horrendous number of people at once, not because H.G. Wells wrote a book.  The World Set Free was published more than a decade after the atom was discovered, and research was already well under way by then.  If Wells' book had never been written, we would have built atomic weapons for use in WWII anyway.  Once mankind finds a new toy, it is only a matter of time before we figure out how to murder each other with it.  Wells was probably the first author to mention atomic weapons, but only because we were rapidly approaching the realization of the hideous potential of such weapons.  And if you read the story yourself, you will see that he had no idea how a real atomic bomb might work, or how atomic energy might be harnessed.\nIn short, no, we didn't invent atomic weapons because of Wells' story.  We invented them because we are monsters.\n\nFurther reading:\nThe Birth of Modern Physics\nChronology of the Atomic Age\nHistory of Nuclear Power \nHistory of Nuclear Energy \nHistory of Nuclear Weapons \n",

We don't seem to witness anything like this happening on screen, in my opinion, although there are some fans who say otherwise. \nIt is impossible to talk about this fan theory without making reference to the extremely contentious issue of when Blair was infected/assimilated.  Both John Carpenter and producer Stuart Cohen insist that neither they, nor anyone else, know when any of the off-screen assimilations took place, but Cohen has suggested that, in his own opinion as a fan (but not as the producer), he thinks Blair was assimilated sometime between the autopsy on the two headed (popularly known as \"split face\") Thing and his freak out in the radio room.  This fan theory conforms to this general time frame.  \nAccording to this particular fan theory, which is just one of many such theories regarding the question of when Blair was infected, Blair inadvertently infected himself during the autopsy.  From the fan site Outpost 31's discussion thread on the issue of Blair's infection:\n\n\nIf this theory is correct, and if split face was really dead, then it appears that a dead Thing can infect a person.  \nAs I was writing this, it occurred to me that the Blair pencil theory isn't necessary to prove that a dead Thing can infect a person.  All we need to know is whether the split face Thing was actually dead, because Bennings was unquestionably infected by split face - or at least by the slimy tentacle dripping off of split face.  \nWhen split face, covered in a sheet after the autopsy, is moved into the storage room, Bennings and Windows go into the room to collect their gear and move it.  Windows leaves to get the Garry's keys, and we see a slimy tentacle emerging from under the sheet.  \n\nWhen Windows returns, he sees this:\n\nBennings is in the process of being assimilated.  Windows is naturally terrified, and runs out of the room.  He alerts the others, but by the time they reach the storage room, the window is broken and Bennings-Thing is gone.  They run outside and spot the Thing, surround it, and it produces what might be the most incredible sound ever heard in a movie:  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, if split face was truly dead when MacReady and Copper found it, then it is almost certain that a dead Thing is still infectious.  The problem with this idea is that, after the team discovers that Bennings has been infected, they seem to assume that split face wasn't as dead as they had previously believed, so they drag it outside and burn it.  \nIn the absence of definitive information about the status of split face at the time of Bennings' assimilation, this argument is completely conjectural in nature, and the most we can infer from Bennings' fate is that a Thing which appears to be dead can still be infectious.\nIf we rely on the Blair theory, the problem is compounded:  we still don't know whether split face was really dead, and on top of that, we don't know if this was really the moment when Blair was infected.  \nHowever, I don't see how anyone could argue that split face was truly dead, in light of the fact that it extended a tentacle and grabbed Bennings.  This leaves us right where we started - we just don't have enough information to answer the question either way. \nIn short, we simply don't know.\n",

It is 1976, isn't it?\" he asked, suddenly uncertain.\n\"Yes, sir,\" one of the technicians standing by the time machine said respectfully. \"The experiment with an atomic warhead guided missile that resulted in the Blight was conducted on this site on April 18, 1976.\" He glanced proudly at the unemotional men on the couches, very much like a small boy after completing a recitation before visiting dignitaries from the Board of Education.\n\"Just so,\" Abd Sadha nodded. \"April 18, 1976. And on this site. You see, young man, you will materialize at the very moment and on the very spot where the remote-control station handling the missile was--er--handling the missile. You will be in a superb position, a superb position, to deflect the missile in its downward course and alter human history for the better. Yes.\"\nHe paused, having evidently stumbled out of his thought sequence.\n\"And he pulls the red switch toward him,\" Gomez, the dandelion-root magnate, reminded him sharply, impatiently.\n\"Ah, yes, the red switch. He pulls the little red switch toward him. Thank you, Mr. Gomez, thank you very much, sir. He pulls the little red switch on the green instrument panel toward him, thus preventing the error that caused the missile to explode in the Brazilian jungle and causing it, instead, to explode somewhere in the mid-Pacific, as originally planned.\"\n\nNeedless to say, when 2089 rolls around again, the explosion in the Pacific has had (different but) equally dire consequences, and once again they try the time-machine fix. The ending:\n\nHe materialized the time machine around the green instrument panel, disregarding the roomful of military figures since he knew they could not see him. The single red switch pointed downward on the instrument panel. That was the device that controlled the course of the missile. Now!

Batman and his allies have been bound and doused in gasoline, with Joker warning against escaping at the risk of agitating the flint in the cave; everyone in the Bat-family save for Batman have also been bandaged. A brainwashed Alfred serves them with a cloche seemingly containing their own severed faces. When Joker threatens to ignite the gasoline, Batman escapes and triggers a blaze, but uses an explosive and his knowledge of the cave system to blow its roof open, allowing water to rush in from above and douse the flames. When he frees the others and they take their bandages off, it is revealed that they still have their faces \u2014 the whole scene was a sick ploy by Joker.\n\nthen\n\n Batman pursues Joker to the edge of a large drop. Batman claims that he knows Joker's true identity, but to prevent him from saying it, Joker purposefully knocks himself over the edge and falls out of sight; Batman finds a notebook which Joker claimed held the secret identities of the Bat-family, but discovers it is blank. Meanwhile, the Bat-family are gassed into attacking each other, but manage to fight off the gas' influence. Later, in Wayne Manor, Batman tells a recovering Alfred that after finding the joker playing card in the cave, he confronted Joker about it in Arkham Aslyum as Bruce Wayne. Joker failed to acknowledge him and Batman realized that he did not care who Batman was under his mask.\n\nJust to make it clear, the writer has since stated that Batman \"has physical evidence that The Joker couldn't have been in the cave ... he's positive that this didn't happen\".\n",
